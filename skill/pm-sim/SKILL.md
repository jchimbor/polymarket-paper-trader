# pm-sim

Paper trading simulator for [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) prediction markets. Executes trades against **live order books** — real prices, real slippage, real fees — without risking real money.

Part of [agent-next](https://github.com/agent-next) — open research lab for self-evolving autonomous agents.

## What you can do

You have a full paper trading account on Polymarket. You can:

- **Search and browse** active prediction markets (politics, crypto, sports, AI, etc.)
- **Buy and sell** outcome shares at live market prices
- **Place limit orders** (GTC/GTD) that trigger when prices reach your target
- **Track your portfolio** with live P&L, unrealized gains, and position values
- **Analyze performance** — Sharpe ratio, win rate, max drawdown, ROI
- **Resolve markets** when outcomes are determined — winners get $1/share

## Getting started

First, initialize your paper trading account:

```
init_account with balance 10000
```

Then explore markets:

```
search_markets "bitcoin"
list_markets with sort_by "liquidity"
```

## Trading

Buy $100 of YES shares on a market:

```
buy slug="will-bitcoin-hit-100k" outcome="yes" amount_usd=100
```

Sell shares when you want to take profit or cut losses:

```
sell slug="will-bitcoin-hit-100k" outcome="yes" shares=50
```

## Limit orders

Place a limit buy that triggers when the price drops:

```
place_limit_order slug="will-bitcoin-hit-100k" outcome="yes" side="buy" amount=200 limit_price=0.40
```

Check and execute pending orders:

```
check_orders
```

## Monitor and analyze

```
portfolio          — see all open positions with live prices
get_balance        — cash + positions value + total P&L
stats              — Sharpe ratio, win rate, drawdown, ROI
history            — recent trade log
watch_prices       — monitor live prices for specific markets
```

## How it works

- Trades execute against **real Polymarket order books** fetched live via API
- The order book is walked level-by-level, calculating exact average price and slippage
- Fees follow the exact Polymarket formula: `(bps/10000) * min(price, 1-price) * shares`
- All data stored locally in SQLite — your trading history is yours
- Multi-account support — run separate strategies in parallel
